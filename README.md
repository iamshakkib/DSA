# DSA
Standard DSA problem's solution
Solution of classical DSA questions and implememtation of Data-Structures and Algorithms
1) Stack one has implementation of Next Greater element to right left and Next Smaller Element to right and left from Aditya Verma's playlist 
implemented by me.
2) Generic tree contains BFS and DFS traversal of a Generic Tree and many classical questions' solutions.
3) LONGEST PREFIX SUFFIX (LPS) is implemented first in LPSKMP.java and then with the help of this KMP algorithm is implemented.
4) Hashing's important concept Rolling Hash Function is implemented but Rabin Karp through rolling hash function is still incomplete.
